# Java Networking Fixes

This repository contains fixes for compilation errors in the [advanced-java-networking](https://github.com/netanelshriki/advanced-java-networking) project.

## Issues Fixed

1. Added generic support to `HttpResponse` interface
2. Created separate `HttpMethod` enum instead of having it as an inner enum of `HttpRequest`
3. Fixed method signature mismatches between interfaces and implementations
4. Added `Protocol` enum for use by `Connection` implementations
5. Fixed `HttpRequestContext` implementation issues
6. Added `RetryMiddleware` with proper `RetryException` class
7. Created `MethodHandler` interface that was missing
8. Updated signatures in `ConnectionListener` interface

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Method 1: Manual Copy

You can manually copy the fixed files from this repository to your local copy of the advanced-java-networking project.

### Method 2: Using the Script

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/netanelshriki/java-networking-fixes.git
   cd java-networking-fixes
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x apply-fixes.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./apply-fixes.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Clone the original repository
- Create a new branch called "fixes"
- Copy all the fixed files
- Commit the changes
- Push the branch to the original repository

## Generated Files

The following files were created or modified to fix the compilation errors:

1. `src/main/java/com/network/api/http/HttpResponse.java` - Updated to support generics
2. `src/main/java/com/network/api/http/HttpMethod.java` - Created as a standalone enum
3. `src/main/java/com/network/api/http/HttpRequest.java` - Updated to reference the standalone HttpMethod
4. `src/main/java/com/network/impl/http/DefaultHttpResponse.java` - Fixed implementation
5. `src/main/java/com/network/impl/http/DefaultHttpClientConfig.java` - Fixed method signatures
6. `src/main/java/com/network/api/http/HttpResponseException.java` - Updated to handle generic HttpResponse
7. `src/main/java/com/network/impl/http/DefaultHttpRequest.java` - Fixed implementation
8. `src/main/java/com/network/api/connection/Protocol.java` - Added for use by Connection implementations
9. `src/main/java/com/network/api/connection/Connection.java` - Updated to reference Protocol
10. `src/main/java/com/network/api/connection/ConnectionListener.java` - Added missing methods
11. `src/main/java/com/network/api/http/HttpRequestContext.java` - Fixed interface issues
12. `src/main/java/com/network/api/http/middleware/HttpMiddleware.java` - Updated signatures
13. `src/main/java/com/network/middleware/http/RetryMiddleware.java` - Created with RetryException
14. `src/main/java/com/network/proxy/MethodHandler.java` - Added missing interface

## Explanation of the Errors

The main compilation errors were caused by:

1. Type parameter issues with HttpResponse - the interface wasn't defined as generic but was being used with type parameters
2. Missing classes and methods that were referenced but not defined in the codebase
3. Method signature mismatches between interfaces and their implementations
4. Access modifiers issues where private inner classes were being accessed from outside their containing class

These fixes should resolve all the compilation errors listed in the build output.
